**I tested 3 AI writing tools for 30 days. Here's what I learned about Semrush, Anyword, and Jasper**

I run a small marketing agency and was tired of spending hours on content creation. Decided to test the top 3 AI writing tools everyone keeps talking about.

**TL;DR:**
- **Semrush** = Best if you need SEO + content in one place
- **Anyword** = Best ROI for conversion-focused copy
- **Jasper** = Best for teams doing high-volume content

**Full breakdown:**

**Semrush ($129.95/mo)**
- Pros: Complete SEO toolkit included, keyword research is insane, content optimization actually works
- Cons: Pricey if you only need writing (but worth it if you do SEO)
- Best for: Anyone serious about ranking content
- They have a 7-day free trial

**Anyword ($49/mo)**
- Pros: Predictive performance scoring (tells you which copy will convert BEFORE you publish), best value
- Cons: Limited SEO features
- Best for: Ad copy, landing pages, emails
- Honestly the best bang for buck

**Jasper ($49/mo)**
- Pros: Great for long-form, tons of templates, team features
- Cons: Needs Surfer SEO integration for optimization (extra cost)
- Best for: Content teams, agencies

**My honest take:**

If you're doing SEO work, Semrush is a no-brainer despite the price. You're getting 10+ tools in one.

If you just need killer copy that converts, Anyword at $49/mo is the move.

If you're a team creating lots of blog content, Jasper's collaboration features are solid.

I made a detailed comparison page with all the features side-by-side if anyone wants it (not sure if I can post links here, but it's in my profile).

**Questions I'm expecting:**

*"What about ChatGPT?"*
ChatGPT is great for brainstorming but these tools have specific features for marketing (SEO optimization, performance prediction, brand voice training) that ChatGPT doesn't.

*"Are these worth it?"*
For me, yes. I'm saving ~10 hours/week on content. ROI is there if you're actually using them.

*"Which one did you stick with?"*
I'm using Semrush because I need the SEO tools anyway. But I kept Anyword for ad copy - the performance scoring is too good.

Happy to answer questions!
